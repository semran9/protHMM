Description: Calculates a comprehensive list of features from profile hidden markov models (HMMs) of proteins. 
    Adapts and ports features for use with HMMs instead of Position Specific Scoring Matrices, in order to take 
    advantage of more accurate multiple sequence alignment by programs such as HHBlits and HMMer. Features calculated 
    by this package can be used for protein fold classification, protein structural class prediction, subcellular 
    localization and protein-protein interaction, among other tasks.
