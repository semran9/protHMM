\usage{
hmm_SepDim(hmm, l = 7)
}
\arguments{
\item{hmm}{The name of a profile hidden markov model file.}

\item{l}{Spatial distance between dimer residues.}
}
\value{
A vector of length 400
}
\description{
This feature calculates the probabilistic expression of amino acid dimers that are spatially separated by a distance \eqn{l}.
Mathematically, this is done with a 20 x 20 matrix \eqn{F}, in which \eqn{F[m, n] = \sum_{i = 1}^{L-l} H_{i, m}H_{i+k, n}}.
\eqn{H} corresponds to the original HMM matrix, and \eqn{L} is the number of rows in \eqn{H}. Matrix \eqn{F} is then flattened to
a feature vector of length 400, and returned.
