\usage{
hmm_smooth(hmm, sw = 7)
}
\arguments{
\item{hmm}{The name of a profile hidden markov model file.}

\item{sw}{The size of the sliding window.}
}
\value{
A matrix of dimensions L \eqn{\times} 20.
}
\description{
This feature smooths the HMM matrix \eqn{H} by using sliding window of length \eqn{sw} to incorporate information
from up and downstream residues into each row of the HMM matrix. Each HMM row \eqn{r_i} is made into the summation
of \eqn{r_{i-(sw/2)}+... r_i...+r_{i+(sw/2)}}, for \eqn{i = 1:L}, where \eqn{L} is the number of rows in \eqn{H}.
For rows such as the beginning and ending rows, \eqn{0} matrices of dimensions \eqn{sw/2, 20} are appended to the
original matrix \eqn{H}.
